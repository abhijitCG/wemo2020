For the energy sector, this means leveraging recovery packages and stimulus bills to advance the common goal of energy transition. But change requires more than opportunity alone. To truly transform, our sector must also consider our motivation, the driving force behind action, and capability, the capacity to act in a way that drives progress. The World Energy Markets Observatory (WEMO), Capgemini’s annual thought leadership and Philippe Vié Vice president and sector head for Energy, Utilities and Chemicals, Capgemini research report that tracks the development and transformation of energy markets around the world, examines the sector’s energy transition through these three lenses: the opportunity to evolve, as presented by COVID-19; our motivation to change, as driven by the urgent need for climate mitigation; and our capacity for transformation, as realized through technology, new business models and cross-industry collaboration. In the following pages, we invite readers to review the key findings of the latest WEMO as well as perspectives from industry experts in markets around the world. We hope you find this year’s WEMO interesting, insightful and, most of all, inspiring as well call on all energy players to make carbon neutrality our new reality. Colette Lewiner Senior energy advisor to Capgemini Chairman Our planet remains far from reaching our global climate objectives. Extension of the 2019 trajectory would lead to a global temperature increase of 3.1-3.7°C by 2050– well above the 1.5- 2°C threshold experts recommend.” Colette Lewiner Senior Energy Advisor to Capgemini Chairman   Global Editorial WEMO A global perspective Colette Lewiner Read More        World Energy Markets Observatory Full Report Read More                4 WEMO 2020 Infographic Global Insights  View Now     ","      Oil & Gas Rethinking the future in the face of uncertainty   Volatility has long been an accepted part of operating in the Oil & Gas (O&G) industry. But while prices have varied widely over the past several decades, demand has remained mostly steady— until now. In the current market, there is increasing uncertainty on future demand for oil and gas. In fact, one sustainable scenario provided by the International Energy Agency (IEA) shows that demand could fall by one- third over the next two decades. Our research shows a number of factors driving this forecast— from adoption of electric cars to electrification of the industrial heating sector to increased competition from other forms of energy, most notably renewables. Compounding matters, oil and gas companies face new pressure to reduce emissions from both operations and use of petroleum products, impacting profitability as well as license to operate. As a result, long-term price assumptions are being questioned. Lower demand will likely lead to a dip in prices. Perhaps more concerning, the growing use of renewables and other alternative energy sources will prevent high, sustained peaks in oil and gas prices over time. For O&G companies, the need to transition beyond a traditional business model is both clear and urgent. As cashflow tightens and volatility increases, these organizations will need to develop a long-term strategy to diversify their revenue from traditional production—or face an even more uncertain future.

With few energy players aside from the EU majors showing much ambition in their current and future sustainability plans, it is likely that these emissions will increase over time. Perhaps more concerning, our analysis suggests that many players are not accounting for their emissions at all. None of the 50 biggest O&G operators have a sustainability roadmap that meets the “2 degrees guidelines” and just one in ten have a sustainability roadmap that addresses the objectives of the Paris agreement.            300000 250000 200000 150000 100000 50000 0 Source: EIA Jan-15 Jul-15 Jan-16 Jul-16 Jan-17 Jul-17 Jan-18 Jul-18 Jan-19 Jul-19 Jan-20 Jul-20 U.S. LNG exports North America: Changing strategies for gas export In 2019, the U.S. strengthened its position as a liquified natural gas (LNG) exporter. An increase in liquification terminals enabled double-digit growth in exports mainly to Europe, reducing the region’s energy dependence on Russia. According to the International Energy Agency, the U.S. is expected to supply 85 percent of new oil and 30 percent of new gas until 2030—a significant change since our last publication. While LNG production significantly increases own emissions for most O&G players, it enables an international market for gas production and asset backed trading. Our analysis suggests that LNG as a product can emit lower carbon overall and is one way for O&G companies to improve the overall emissions intensity of their portfolio while avoiding reliance on pipeline infrastructure.         6 WEMO 2020 Million Cubic Feet ","    Climate Change & Sustainability Long-term climate change goals remain out of reach, despite a significant reduction in energy emissions due to COVID-19 Real-time emissions in 2020 A green recovery In June, the International Energy Agency (IEA) published an ambitious and carefully researched three-year economic stimulus and recovery plan in response to COVID-19. With investments totaling $1T per year, the vast majority of which would come from private sources, this plan demonstrates how the world can boost economic growth, create jobs and build a more resilient and cleaner energy system. According to their modelling, global annual energy-related CO2 emissions would be nearly 3.5 Gt lower than projected levels and methane emissions would be cut by 0.8 Gt CO2- eq. In addition, around 420 million people would gain clean cooking solutions in low-income countries and nearly 270 million people would have access to electricity. The authors of the World Energy Markets Observatory view this plan as a framework worthy of real consideration. It is our belief that the world must come together to address the financing, regulatory and coordination obstacles associated with implementing this plan or one similar in order to effect meaningful and sustained progress against global climate change goals.        Over the past ten months, COVID-19 led to a significant dip in electricity and gas demand with global consumption falling by up to 20 percent. As a result, the world experienced the largest reduction of GHG emissions since World War II. But what may appear to be a bright spot in the world’s climate change journey proves far more complex upon close examination. Our analysis reveals that emission reductions driven by travel restrictions and a pause in industrial activity spurred by COVID-19 are not sustainable, as emission levels have rebounded as countries emerge from lockdown. Perhaps more alarming, even if these changes were sustainable, they would not be enough to help the world reach the 2030 and 2050 targets outlined in the Paris agreement. Our research reveals that even in Europe, the most advanced region in terms of climate change, current policies and measures fall well short of long-term decarbonization objectives and the 1.5-2° scenario identified by the International Energy Agency (IEA). As in years past, the latest edition of the World Energy Markets Observatory underscores the need for long-term, sustainable change, as realized through cross-industry transformation, accelerated adoption of digital and sector technologies and prioritization and incentivization of green investments and initiatives. -8.5%     Featured Infographic Climate Change and Sustainability Insights View Now   7  ","      The impact of COVID-19: How the pandemic prompted a dramatic reduction in GHG emissions COVID-19 led to the largest reduction of GHG emissions since World War II with emissions forecast to fall 8 percent in 2020. However, this decrease is conjunctural and nonstructural, meaning that emissions will likely rise as the world recovers from the pandemic and daily life resumes. Still, this event demonstrates the scale at which the world must act in order to address the climate change crisis.

On one hand, there is an understandable impatience to return to the so-called “new normal” of a post-COVID world. On the other, we see a push from industry leaders, the scientific community and some governments to use this crisis as an opportunity to reset and refocus the world’s climate agenda. In this year’s WEMO report, we urge stakeholders to use sustainability as an anchor in COVID-19 recovery efforts. Several findings from our research support the feasibility and value of this point of view, including: falling costs for renewable energy sources, particularly solar PV and wind, making them the cheapest sources of new-build generation; increased capacity from present and future renewable investments; the potential for the green energy sector to become a global growth engine, both as a GDP stimulator and job creator As in issues past, the 22nd edition of WEMO examines these opportunities against the backdrop of an increasingly bleak environmental forecast, the likes of which will disproportionately affect the world’s most vulnerable populations. This is why the authors of our report are so gravely concerned by the possibility that the world may let yet another opportunity for change pass us by, opting instead to focus on more immediate concerns related to health, education and restarting the economy. In this year’s WEMO, we explore how energy transition is inextricably intertwined in these issues and COVID-19 recovery efforts themselves. In these pages, we urge every country, every industry, every organization, every person to make bold climate change agenda part of their new normal.

Today, as the world grapples with the effect of COVID-19, we see that this strategy is no longer viable due to strict social distancing measures and low profitability. In this new environment, every energy organization must maintain their focus on the top priority of energy transition, albeit through a revised growth strategy. The latest edition of WEMO identifies several new operating models and strategies for organizations to manage the increased volatility, diminished predictability and high financial pressure introduced by the pandemic.

At the same time, our research indicates that these methods are neither sustainable nor particularly effective. Experts suggest that in order to meet long-term climate change goals, the world would need to institute lockdown measures similar to those adopted this past spring every year for the next decade. Thankfully, the world need not take such drastic and disruptive measures. This year’s WEMO identifies six key recommendations for energy organizations to help the world achieve long-term climate change objectives outlined in the Paris Accord: A closer look : View the detailed recommendations Read the article       Master GHG emissions through comprehensive, meaningful carbon pricing 02 Incentivize the construction of carbon free generation plants 01       Incentivize the electrification of uses, particularly as it relates to transportation and mobility 03 04 05 Develop and scale green hydrogen capabilities    Accelerate grid modernization through at-scale deployment of the smart grid, demand flexibility applications and new grid tariff calculations       12 WEMO 2020 06 Ensure stimulus plans prioritize advancement of the green agenda ","  Conclusion Capgemini’s ten-year countdown to net zero has begun Capgemini believes fully in the climate change and sustainability recommendations outlined in this year’s World Energy Markets Observatory. Capgemini recently announced our ambitious plan to achieve carbon neutrality no later than 2025 and become a net zero business by 2030. A true leader in this area, our plan builds on strong progress in delivering our previous headline target of a 30% reduction in carbon emissions per employee, in January 2020, a decade ahead of schedule. As part of this program we:  Decreased travel emissions by 22% per employee (2019 vs 2015)  Reduced energy consumption by 20% (2019 vs 2015)  Nearly doubled our use of renewable energy in 2019 alone In our quest to become a net zero company, we will continue to build on these existing programs and expand our agenda to include:  Switching to 100% renewable electricity;  Transitioning our company fleet to electric vehicles;  Increasing investment in sustainable travel initiatives;  Expanding our virtual collaboration initiatives to further reduce global travel;  Investing in high-quality carbon offset projects like re-forestation that remove carbon from the atmosphere for any remaining emissions. Our program will also seek to reduce the impact of our value chain, working closely with suppliers to reduce and offset emissions in the products and services we use. Through this initiative, our company plans to be net zero by 2030. After presenting the dire need for action through this year’s WEMO report, we ask: Will you join us? “The current global situation with the COVID-19 pandemic has amplified the importance of the need to live in balance with our planet. Capgemini has had a decade long focus on reducing environmental impacts and whilst much has been achieved to date, we are now announcing our increased ambition. I have put acting on climate change at the heart of our Group priorities with a focal point of our ambitious target of net zero by 2030.” Aiman Ezzat Capgemini’s Chief Executive Officer Watch Now      13     ","  For more details contact: Contact-head; name Contact-info; title/role Contact-info; address Contact-info; email Contact-head; name Contact-info; title/role Contact-info; address Contact-info; email Contact-head; name Contact-info; title/role Contact-info; address Contact-info; email Contact-head; name Contact-info; title/role Contact-info; address Contact-info; email About Capgemini Capgemini is a global leader in consulting, digital transformation, technology and engineering services.
